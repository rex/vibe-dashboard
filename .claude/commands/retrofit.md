# /retrofit — brownfield agent-readiness retrofit

This command runs the 5-PR brownfield sequence top-to-bottom. The user
invoking it IS the consent — proceed without any "are we doing this?"
check. Each PR is one commit; each commit pushes immediately.

## Step 0 — Detect git environment

Before applying any PR, detect the working tree's shape. Each PR's
CHECKLIST starts with `git checkout -b chore/...` — that fails if
this is a worktree, detached HEAD, or trunk-strategy repo.

```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null   # is this a git repo?
git symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>/dev/null         # current branch (empty = detached)
git worktree list 2>/dev/null                     # main checkout vs worktree?
git config --get remote.origin.url 2>/dev/null    # remote URL (empty = no remote)
test -f VIBE.yaml && grep -E '^\s*branch_strategy:' VIBE.yaml  # trunk vs feature-branch?
```

What to do with each signal:

- **Detached HEAD or worktree:** skip the `git checkout -b` step in
  every CHECKLIST. Push with `git push origin HEAD:<trunk>` (where
  `<trunk>` is the trunk branch — usually `main`, sometimes `master`).
- **`branch_strategy: trunk` in VIBE.yaml:** also skip `git checkout
  -b`. Commit directly on the current branch and push.
- **No remote:** push steps no-op silently. Surface that and ask the
  user to add a remote, or proceed without push.

If everything is normal (attached HEAD, single checkout, no trunk
strategy), follow each CHECKLIST verbatim.

## Step 1 — Discovery (minimal — most answers come from the repo)

Read what's already there before asking anything:

```
git log --oneline -20      # context for recent activity
ls -la                     # top-level layout
cat README.md              # stated purpose (or AGENTS.md if present)
test -f pyproject.toml && echo python      # stack signal
test -f package.json && echo typescript    # stack signal
test -f Cargo.toml && echo rust            # stack signal
test -f go.mod && echo go                  # stack signal
test -f VIBE.yaml && cat VIBE.yaml         # existing repo policy
```

Then ask only what you can't infer:

### Q1 — primary stack confirmation

"Repo looks like `<inferred stack>`. Confirm or correct?"

### Q2 — autonomy mode

`interactive` (default) | `continue-until-blocked`. If `VIBE.yaml`
already has `workflow.default_autonomy_mode`, default to that.

### Q3 — anything weird up front? (free-text, optional)

Persist answers to `.claude/session-context.md`:

```markdown
# Session context
mode: brownfield
stack: <q1>
autonomy: <q2>
created: <ISO timestamp>
updated: <ISO timestamp>
fast_path: false

## Q3 freeform notes
<q3 if provided>
```

## Step 2 — Detect already-applied PRs

```
~/.claude/skills/agentic-skeleton/scripts/bootstrap_brownfield.py
```

The script (no args) detects which of PR1–PR5 are already in place
and prints the next PR's `CHECKLIST.md` path. This catches
partial-retrofit state from prior attempts.

**Out-of-order partial state is valid.** If the detection reports e.g.
PR1 ✓, PR2 ✗, PR3 ✗, PR4 ✓, PR5 ✗ (someone manually added a
TASK_STATE.md before retrofitting), don't un-apply PR4. The script
recommends the lowest-numbered unapplied PR; apply them in order
from there. The "applied" PRs are accepted as-is.

## Step 2a — Validate existing VIBE.yaml (if present)

Many repos already have a `VIBE.yaml` from an earlier (partial)
retrofit, a manual seed, or a previous schema version. Before PR1
copies the brownfield seed (which would error on existing-file
collision), validate what's there and surface drift:

```bash
# Does VIBE.yaml exist in the target repo?
test -f VIBE.yaml && echo present || echo absent
```

If present:

```bash
# 1. Schema-validate against the current canonical schema:
~/.claude/skills/agentic-skeleton/scripts/validate_vibe_yaml.py
#    Hard-requires `check-jsonschema`; install via:
#      uv tool install check-jsonschema
#    OR
#      pip install --user check-jsonschema
#    The script prints actionable errors with field paths + reasons.

# 2. Compare structure against the brownfield seed to surface drift
#    (missing fields, schema_version skew, removed/renamed sections):
diff <(grep -E '^[a-z_]+:' VIBE.yaml | sort) \
     <(grep -E '^[a-z_]+:' \
       ~/.claude/skills/agentic-skeleton/templates/brownfield/PR1-seed-memory/files/VIBE.yaml | sort)
```

Possible outcomes and what to do for each:

- **Validation passes; no structural drift** → file is current. Tell
  the user "VIBE.yaml is conformant; PR1 will skip it." Then in PR1's
  CHECKLIST (Step 2), do NOT copy `VIBE.yaml` from the seed; PR1
  becomes AGENTS.md + symlinks + .gitignore-additions only.

- **Validation passes but structural drift exists** (missing
  optional fields the current schema added; new operational-policy
  fields with defaults the existing file doesn't set) → propose a
  **migration patch** to the user: show the diff of fields the seed
  has that the existing file lacks, ask which to add, leave
  operational-policy fields at schema defaults unless the user
  explicitly directs otherwise (per `~/.claude/skills/agentic-skeleton/
  references/agent-behavior.md::Operational policy comes from the user
  explicitly`). Apply the agreed patch; commit as a separate
  `chore: migrate VIBE.yaml to current schema` commit BEFORE PR1.

- **Validation fails** → fix the validation errors first. The script
  reports specific field paths that violate the schema. Common cases:
  `schema_version` mismatch (older repo using `schema_version: 0`),
  removed fields (`workflow.foo` that's no longer in the schema),
  type errors (string where the schema expects an enum).

- **`schema_version` is older than current** → the schema is
  versioned. Cross-reference `~/.claude/skills/agentic-skeleton/
  references/vibe-yaml-schema.md` for the migration path between
  versions. Surface to the user; do not silently rewrite.

After this step, EITHER the existing VIBE.yaml is conformant and PR1
skips copying it, OR a migration commit has landed and the file is
now conformant. PR1 then proceeds with the remaining artifacts
(AGENTS.md + symlinks + .gitignore-additions).

## Step 3 — Apply PRs in sequence

For each unapplied PR, follow its `CHECKLIST.md` verbatim. Each PR
is one commit; each commit pushes immediately.

| PR | What it adds | CHECKLIST |
|---|---|---|
| **PR1: seed memory** | `AGENTS.md` (≤100 lines), `VIBE.yaml` with brownfield defaults, `CLAUDE.md` + `GEMINI.md` symlinks, `.gitignore` additions, the standard `Makefile` (existing one backed up to `Makefile.pre-retrofit`) + `scripts/{bump_version,check_version_bumped,check_architecture}.py`. **stop-gate.sh hard-requires `check_architecture.py` — never skip the script seed.** | `~/.claude/skills/agentic-skeleton/templates/brownfield/PR1-seed-memory/CHECKLIST.md` |
| **PR2: map + annotate** | `MAP.md` with module table, gotchas, hot/cold paths, extension points; per-module READMEs | `~/.claude/skills/agentic-skeleton/templates/brownfield/PR2-map-annotate/CHECKLIST.md` |
| **PR3: MCP install** | `.mcp.json` (github, Context7, sequential-thinking), `scripts/mcp/op-headers.sh` (the 1Password `headersHelper`), `.env.example` note that MCP credentials do NOT live in `.env` | `~/.claude/skills/agentic-skeleton/templates/brownfield/PR3-mcp-install/CHECKLIST.md` |
| **PR4: state tracking** | `PROGRESS.md`, `TASK_STATE.md`, `specs/_template/` | `~/.claude/skills/agentic-skeleton/templates/brownfield/PR4-state-tracking/CHECKLIST.md` |
| **PR5: delegation hooks** | `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/commands/` (incl. `/scaffold`, `/retrofit`), `.claude/hooks/`, `.claude/rules/`, `.claude/settings.json`. **Watch the .gitignore guard** (next paragraph). | `~/.claude/skills/agentic-skeleton/templates/brownfield/PR5-delegation-hooks/CHECKLIST.md` |

**`.claude/` blanket-ignored gotcha (PR5):** Many existing repos have
`.claude/` as a single line in `.gitignore`. After PR5's `cp` step,
`git add .claude/` will silently no-op — git ignores everything
under that pattern. PR5's CHECKLIST has an explicit verification
step ("Verify .claude/ tracking") that catches this; **do not skip
it**. Fix is to replace the blanket `.claude/` ignore with selective
ignores (see PR5 CHECKLIST step for the exact lines).

**Heredoc commit-message gotcha:** `bash-guard.sh` blocks commit
invocations whose message body contains a blocked pattern (e.g. a PR
description mentioning `rm -rf /`). Workaround:

```bash
cat > /tmp/commit-msg <<'EOF'
chore: <message>

Body that mentions blocked patterns like rm -rf / safely.
EOF
git commit -S -F /tmp/commit-msg
rm /tmp/commit-msg
```

`-F <file>` reads the message from a file; the hook sees only the
file path on the command line, not the contents.

**Operational-policy fields in `VIBE.yaml` (PR1) stay at schema
defaults** unless the user explicitly directs otherwise:
`workflow.default_autonomy_mode: interactive`,
`workflow.ask_before_dockerizing: true`,
`quality_gates.tests.mode: deferred`,
`reporting.completion_report.detail_level: standard`. Per
`~/.claude/skills/agentic-skeleton/references/agent-behavior.md::Operational
policy comes from the user explicitly`.

## Step 4 — Verify

After PR5:

- `make validate` (if Makefile exists) passes.
- All hooks fire on a fresh session — open a new Claude Code session
  in the repo and confirm `session-start.sh` injects context.
- Smoke-test: ask "what's the setup command for this repo?" — the
  agent should answer from `AGENTS.md §2` without rediscovery.

## Step 5 — Tell the user what's now possible

After retrofit:

- `/plan <slice>` — spec-driven planning subagent.
- `/implement-slice` — per-slice implementation flow.
- `/review`, `/ship`, `/debug`, `/adr`, `/terraform-plan` — the rest
  of the working loop.
- Continued `/retrofit` runs become idempotent (script detects
  applied PRs and skips them).
