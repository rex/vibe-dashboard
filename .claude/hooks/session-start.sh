# SessionStart hook — establishes context on a fresh session AND
# re-establishes context after compaction.
#
# What this hook does:
# Injects the five standing rules + repo state (branch, recent commits,
# FULL TASK_STATE.md, PROGRESS.md, SESSION_NOTES) so the agent has its
# bearings BEFORE the first user prompt. The model treats
# additionalContext as ambient orientation (same priority as
# system-reminders and config boilerplate), so this is context
# establishment — NOT enforcement.
#
# Compaction defense:
# SessionStart fires on `resume` after Claude Code compacts the
# conversation. The full TASK_STATE.md dump here is what survives
# compaction — there's no separate PreCompact hook (Claude Code's
# PreCompact event does not accept hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext,
# so any output we emitted there was rejected with a schema error).
#
# What this hook does NOT do:
# - Run discovery. The /scaffold and /retrofit slash commands own
#   that. SessionStart cannot pause for input and the model treats
#   "RUN DISCOVERY NOW" injection as ambient signal that loses to
#   foreground task framing. See
#   agentic-skeleton/references/skill-vs-slash-vs-hook.md.
# - Enforce anything. Every line it injects is ambient orientation.
#   For per-prompt hard enforcement, use a UserPromptSubmit hook.
#
# Hook event semantics:
# - SessionStart fires on `startup | resume | clear` exactly once.
# - additionalContext is treated as ambient orientation by the model;
#   compliance with content injected here is SOFT.
# - For per-prompt hard enforcement, use a UserPromptSubmit hook.

# ─── Standing rules (always injected — soft compliance) ───────────────

ctx+="### Standing rules\n"
ctx+="Compliance is soft (this is ambient context, not a foreground command), but these are universal:\n"
ctx+="1. **Push every commit.** Commits are atomic with their push. Never leave committed-but-unpushed state. Pushing your commits does NOT push the user's uncommitted files in other paths.\n"
ctx+="2. **No snowflake-hack workarounds.** When a managed system fails (CI, Ansible, deploy script, declarative pipeline), diagnose and fix root cause. Do NOT route around with one-off scripts. Framing a workaround as one of \"three options, your call\" is the SAME anti-pattern.\n"
ctx+="3. **Cross-repo \`git add\` discipline.** When committing in any repo where the user has in-flight work, run \`git status\` first and stage by path (\`git add <specific paths>\`), never \`git add -A\` or \`git add .\`.\n"
ctx+="4. **Grep-verify critical edits.** After editing CI workflows (.github/workflows/*.yml, .gitea/workflows/*.yml), Dockerfiles, deploy configs, or anything under palantir/ / homelab-autodeploy/, grep-verify the change landed before committing. The Edit tool occasionally returns success without persisting; one grep catches it.\n"
ctx+="5. **Operational policy comes from the user explicitly.** When you encounter an unset operational-policy field in VIBE.yaml (slice-completion behavior, stop-gate behavior, autonomy thresholds), use the schema default. Do NOT pick a non-default value because it 'seems right' for the user's situation. Operational policy is the user's call, not yours.\n\n"
